  "tagline": "A wordpress microblogging theme for short update messages, inspired by Twitter, derived from P2 and houston.",
  "body": "Chatter is a reworked and modified combination of P2 (https://p2theme.com/) and the woocommerce Houston child theme (https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/houston/). It features inline comments, a posting form on the homepage, inline editing of posts and comments, real-time updates, a device-agnostic responsive design. Chatter includes two widget regions and  features integration with the \"Chatter likes\" plugin.  The default design is twitter-like, complete with twitter-like 'time ago' post and comment timing, as well as a twitter like layout. It was put together for a project and is currently not slated to get updates.\r\n\r\nIt's cobbled together, but feel free to use and improve it, if there is interest (and you don't want to go and support the awesome people at P2 with your contributions) then we'll see where it goes! For now though, it is a quick and dirty build to scratch one particular itch.\r\n\r\nIt currently lacks some of the elements of P2, including translation and rtl support.",
  "note": "Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."
